    A rescue might have a more involved screening process, which can take more time, but can help you adopt a pet that is more likely to be an easier match for your home. 
    Adoption fees are often higher than a shelter, but often include vet care that would cost more if you paid the vet yourself.
    Common sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters and rescue groups. <br>
    In the vast majority of cases, patience, training, and consistency of care will help the pet overcome its past.
    Others use a guardianship model wherein the organization retains some control over the animal's future use or care.
    Pet adoption is the process of taking responsibility for a pet that a previous owner has abandoned or released to a shelter or rescue organization. 
    Responsible shelters, pounds, and rescue organizations refuse to supply animals to people whom they judge unable to supply the animal with a suitable home. 
    Some organizations give adopters ownership of the pet. 
    Sometimes, a new owner may face training or behavioral challenges with a pet who has been neglected, abused, or left untrained.

  <h2>Process of Adopting a Pet</h2>
  
  <p2>How To Adopt a Pet.
If you’ve never adopted a pet before, you may be wondering, how does the process work? How long does it take? How much does it cost? 
    The information below will help give you an overview of how it works to adopt a pet from the two main types of organizations: Shelters and Rescues.<br> Each organization is different, but it helps to understand the two main types and what to expect, so you can have a better overall pet adoption experience.

Adopting from a Shelter.
Shelters include public shelters like the city and county animal shelters, animal control, police and health departments, dog wardens, and are often called the pound.<br> There are also private shelters that might use the words “humane society” or “SPCA” in their name. They are all separate, independently run organizations or government offices. Just because shelters have similar names does not mean they are connected — just like different banks might have the word “bank” in their name.

Shelters often have a physical facility, with staff, and operating hours. Some have volunteers and do adoption events around town too.<br> If the pet you see on Adopt-a-Pet.com says that pet is at a Shelter and has an address with business hours, the easiest way to adopt that pet may be to go visit. That’s because some shelters are under-staffed and may not answer all phone calls or emails. Especially if the pet listing says ACT QUICKLY you should go to that shelter ASAP to see that pet!

Each shelter’s adoption process is different. Here’s an example of how a shelter adoption might work:<br>
<li>
1.You find a pet you want to adopt on Adopt-a-Pet.com who’s at a shelter.<br>
2.You go to the shelter and see the pet. He’s adorable! You ask at the shelter desk and they have a staff or volunteer take him out so you can meet with him. You fall in love.<br>
3.They put the pet back, and you go up to the shelter desk, give them your photo ID, pay the adoption fee (average range is $25 to $125), and get copies of the pet’s vaccination records and sterilization certificate so you can get him licensed.<br>
4.You take your new pet home!

  Ask anyone who has adopted a pet and they’ll share with you their story of love, fun and companionship. 
  If fewer than 10 percent of them just 2.4 million choose to adopt.
  Moving and landlord issues are the top reasons people give up their pets.
  Note: Dogs and cats who are taken into the care of shelters and rescue groups each year find themselves homeless through no fault of their own; 
  We will save all the dogs and cats who currently enter shelters but don’t find homes!
  Why? Because shelter pets are amazing!
