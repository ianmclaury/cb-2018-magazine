  Ask anyone who has adopted a pet and they’ll share with you their story of love, fun and companionship. 
  Why? Because shelter pets are amazing!
  Within the next year, 29 million people just like you intend to bring a pet into their families. 
  If fewer than 10 percent of them just 2.4 million choose to adopt.
  We will save all the dogs and cats who currently enter shelters but don’t find homes!
  Note: Dogs and cats who are taken into the care of shelters and rescue groups each year find themselves homeless through no fault of their own; 
  Moving and landlord issues are the top reasons people give up their pets.
