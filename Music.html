      Following the sudden resurfacing of one of Hip-Hop's revolutionaires, Kanye West, he's been under heavy fire for his abnormal behaviors.
      Specifically, his comment regarding slavery and posing in a "Make America Great Again" cap was not taken lightly espeically by the African-American community. 
      He deemed that slavery "was a choice" just days after publicly supporting Donald Trump. As an African-American himself, the community was extremely disappointed
      Over the years, we've been able to deal with Mr. West's unpredictability; from Taylor Swift and the VMAs all the way back to the song "Jesus Walks" where he rhymed about religion, a boundary artist's rarely cross becuase of the fear of offending the audience.
      However, the multi-time Grammy award winner took it too far this time. In a video revealing Kanye at the TMZ offices, he could be seen getting told off by a reporter.
      In what was a bold move to stand up to the celebrity, the worker was preaching the truth to him. The interaction ended in Kanye aplogizing for his actions.*

      Regardless of Kanye West's recent actions, the argument is brewing as to wheather or not his fans should still support his music and ignore him as a person.
      No matter what,
