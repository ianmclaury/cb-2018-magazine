      <h1> Kanye vs the Media </h1>

      Following the sudden resurfacing of one of Hip-Hop's revolutionaires, Kanye West, he's been under heavy fire for his abnormal behaviors.
      Specifically, his comment regarding slavery and posing in a "Make America Great Again" cap was not taken lightly espeically by the African-American community. 
      He deemed that slavery "was a choice" just days after publicly supporting Donald Trump. As an African-American himself, the community was extremely disappointed
      Over the years, we've been able to deal with Mr. West's unpredictability; from Taylor Swift and the VMAs all the way back to the song "Jesus Walks" where he rhymed about religion, a boundary artist's rarely cross becuase of the fear of offending the audience.
      However, the multi-time Grammy award winner took it too far this time. In a video revealing Kanye at the TMZ offices, he could be seen getting told off by a reporter.
      In what was a bold move to stand up to the celebrity, the worker was preaching the truth to him. The interaction ended in Kanye aplogizing for his actions.*

      Regardless of Kanye West's recent actions, the argument is brewing as to wheather or not his fans should still support his music and ignore him as a person or ignore him totally.
      No matter what, his words of today don't take away the appraisal the public had for his old music. 21 Grammy awards, 8 of his 8 albums that went platinum atleast once, and
      numerous singles that charted on Billboard at the #1 spot are all just evidence of his greatness as an artist.Perhaps Kanye will only be respected for his era deemed the "Old Kanye" as his political and historical views have been publicized.

      <h2> "This is America"</h2>
      <p1> Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino's latest song titled "This is America" graced the internet over the weekend. In what seems to be the artist's latest hit since "Redbone", it's the message portrayed in the video that is making headlines.
        All throughout, the video displays imagery of violent acts in America in the background of Gambino and his crew performing viral dances front and center. 
        The purpose of this is to replicate how Americans have responded to gun violence in the past. Sandy Hook, Las Vegas, Parkland. All tragedies mourned for about a week before the American people shifted their focus to other things.
        I think what Glover was trying to say is that the public would pay more attention to viral dances than real issues such as implementing strict gun laws. 
        In other words, America is all talk and no action. We say we want change to make our schools and streets safer for our children but here we are pushing these issues on the backburner.

      <p2> Welcome back, Gambino.</p2>
